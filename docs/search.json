    "text": "I’m Casey Berger and this is my second year at Bates College. At Bates, I’ve taught PHYS 211, PHYS 216, PHYS 301, PHYS 308, and PHYS 409. Before Bates, I was at Smith College in Physics and Statistical and Data Sciences. And long before that – before I went to school for physics and computational science – I studied philosophy, film production, and Spanish and worked in the film industry. It took me a long time to find my way to physics, but I wouldn’t change any of it. The long and winding path taught me so much more about who I am, what I am capable of, and how many opportunities are available in the world. It also taught me that it’s never too late to find a new passion or change your career direction.\nMy research involves applying high performance computing and data science techniques to many-body quantum systems, which just means studying how medium-to-large numbers of quantum objects like electrons, neutrons, or atoms interact with each other and their environment. This sounds straightforward, but unfortunately the mathematics of quantum mechanics means these problems become impossible to solve by hand and extremely challenging to solve even with high powered computers when the system is still only a few particles.\nOutside of physics, I am a person with lots of interests and hobbies. I love being outdoors in all seasons, but also love reading a book inside with a cup of tea. Ask me for book recommendations, recipes for interesting food, or great hikes in Maine!",

    "section": "Assignments and Grading",
    "text": "Assignments and Grading\nAssignments fall into “bundles,” which contribute to your grade equally. Your performance on each bundle determines your base grade (by averaging the grade in each bundle using the 4-point GPA scale). Beyond that, you can achieve grade boosts, which round your grade up, e.g. from a B to a B+, or a B+ to an A-.\nYou can learn more about each bundle below:\nPractice\nUnit Tests\nFinal Project\nExcellence\n\nGrading Scheme\nAt the end of the term, you will earn a letter grade for this course. That letter grade will be determined following the Four-Square grading chart (below). Each square represents a grading bundle, and you can earn a score of 0-4 for each bundle. At the end of the term, I will calculate an average score for you using the following equation:\nOverall Score = (Practice score + Unit Tests score + Final Project score + Excellence score) / 4\n\nThe resulting overall score will correspond to a letter grade using the percentage table below:\n\nGrade table\n\n\nLetter Grade\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nA+\n97-100%\n\n\nA\n93-96.9%\n\n\nA-\n90-92.9%\n\n\nB+\n87-89.9%\n\n\nB\n83-86.9%\n\n\nB-\n80-82.9%\n\n\nC+\n77-79.9%\n\n\nC\n73-76.9%\n\n\nC-\n70-72.9%\n\n\nD+\n67-69.9%\n\n\nD\n63-66.9%\n\n\nD-\n60-62.9%\n\n\nF\nless than 60%\n\n\n\nYou can then get up to three grade boosts, each of which rounds your grade up (e.g from a B to B+ or from an A- to A). The grade boosts are described more below.\nIf, for example, you achieved a 3 in Practice, a 4 in Unit Tests, a 4 in Final Project, and got a total of 2 “Es”, your base grade would be (3.0 + 4.0 + 4.0 + 2.0)/16 = 81.3%, which would be a B-. With round-ups, your grade could go up to a B, B+, or A-.\n\n\nGrading scales\n\nPointsCompletionE/M/R/N\n\n\nHomeworks and pre-class quizzes will be graded on a points scale. Your total grade for the bundle will be your average points on the assignments. Remember that these are not graded on “correctness” but rather on engaging in good faith.\n\n\nThe five final project components will each have objectives you must meet for them to be considered “complete.” These will be clearly laid out for each component so you know exactly what to do to complete them.\n\n\nQuizzes, group problems, and community engagement are graded on this scale\n\nE: exceeds expectations\nM: meets expectations\nR: revise / retry\nN: no submission\n\nE and M are considered passing grades. The number of Es you get will contribute to your overall grade (see the grading scheme)\nR and N are considered failing grades.\nIn the case of quizzes and group problems, you will have one chance to revise/retry (see more under the assignment descriptions). Community engagement cannot be revised, as it is a reflection of your participation and engagement throughout the unit.\nUnder no circumstances can you revise something you receive an N on. Remember that done is better than perfect – turn your work in so you can receive feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading categories\n\nPracticeUnit testsFinal ProjectExcellence\n\n\nPCQs: In order to get the most out of class, you need to prepare. We will spend most of our time in class practicing problem solving, and before class you will need to read the appropriate sections of the book and take a “quiz”. Some readings are longer than others (and I’ve included the page count in the course schedule so you can be prepared), but every reading quiz is 5 questions, some of which will be practice problems. Given the purpose of the pre-class quizzes, I will not offer extensions, except in case of a major medical or family emergency that causes you to miss class.\nWHW and self-assessment: There are nine homework sets (weekly for the first three-quarters of the semester) as well as a self-reflection form. You will turn in your work on the homework by scanning and uploading as a PDF to Lyceum. These are due by class time on Friday. You will then have a self-reflection due 72 hours later (by class time on Monday).\nThe problem sets are self-graded. Here’s how that works:\n\nYou get 50% of the points just for submitting the homework on time.\nWhen you submit your work, you will receive access to the (detailed) solutions.\nThe rest of the points come from comparing your work to the solutions and filling out a guided self-reflection form.\nThese forms are not intended to make you do “extra work” – these are to help both you and me understand where you need more practice and more support.\n\nYou may request extensions on the homeworks using the extension form.\n\nBundle grades\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\n4.0\nEarn &gt;= 90% average on WHWs AND complete &gt;= 90% of PCQs\n\n\n3.0\nEarn &gt;= 80% average on WHWs AND complete &gt;= 80% of PCQs\n\n\n2.0\nEarn &gt;= 70% average on WHWs AND complete &gt;= 70% of PCQs\n\n\n1.0\nEarn &gt;= 60% average on WHWs AND complete &gt;= 60% of PCQs\n\n\n0.0\nUnder a 60% average on WHWs OR under a 60% average on PCQs\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be three tests on the material in this class. Each test will be offered two times, two weeks apart, giving you two opportunities to achieve your desired grade on the tests. The tests are graded on an E/M/R/N scale, and an E and M are both considered passing grades.\nYou will be provided with an equation sheet for each test, which will have some useful equations, integrals, trig identities, etc. You may also bring a single-sided 8.5”x11” sheet of paper with equations and notes - hand-written (please speak to me if you need to type the sheet and we will come up with a plan). This paper will be turned in with your test.\nIf you have to miss class due to an approved excuse, you may take the test at the testing center. You must do this no more than 2 days before the test is given and no more than 5 days after (i.e. starting the Wednesday before the test and ending the Wednesday after the test), and you can request this option through AESS using this form. This is so I can provide timely feedback to everyone on the test. If you are not sure your absence is excused or you feel you have a special circumstance, come and talk to me about it and we will discuss the options.\nYou don’t have to do anything special to take the test a second time, but I recommend coming to my office hours or scheduling a meeting with me if you are at all confused about what you missed. I am more than happy to help talk you through the test.\n\nBundle grades\n\n\nPoints\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\n4.0\nAt least M on all 3\n\n\n3.0\nAt least M on 2\n\n\n2.0\nAt least M on 1\n\n\n1.0\nAll tests attempted (all Rs)\n\n\n0.0\nAny N grades\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this class, you will have had two semesters of instruction in quantum mechanics and be well-versed in the fundamentals and how to use the mathematics to derive real-world measurements. Now, you get a chance to pick something about quantum mechanics that you want to know more about and dig deeply.\nThis project is designed to be open-ended. I want you be as creative as you want to be. If you want to connect quantum mechanics to the arts, be my guest! If you want to do a deep dive into the historical development of the ideas of quantum mechanics, please enlighten us! If you want to do a computational project where you apply your programming skills to a concept you learned in this class, that would be awesome! If you want to teach a topic from the book that we haven’t covered yet to the rest of the class, we would love that! Want to record a podcast interviewing scientists in the field?

    "text": "Technology Policy\n\nUse of LLMs\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are here to stay, but we should be discerning about how we use them. Banning them from the classroom is both pointless and actively unhelpful. If you are going to use ChatGPT or a similar LLM in this class, I only require two things:\n\nThat you do a little reading on Large Language Models. Specifically, read\n\n\nthis article about how LLMs actually work\nthis article about the ethical considerations around LLMs and intellectual property\nthis article about just one of the many environmental impacts of LLMs\n\n\nThat you consider the LLM a source that you must cite. If you use generative AI to help with any assignment, you must acknowledge that help and give a short (two-sentence) description of what the LLM did for you and how it helped you solve the problem.\n\nRemember that LLMs are designed to predict the most probable response to a question, which is not always the best or even correct response. They are prone to “hallucinating” (making stuff up, often in a way that is convincing but still false). They can’t do creative problem solving, which is the most important skill we are trying to develop in this class.\n\n\nUse of technology during class time\nTechnology is completely infused into our lives, and I’m not trying to convince anyone to stop using it. As a computational physicist, it’s my literal vocation to use digital technology, and as a teacher, I spend many hours a day staring at my screen to write lesson plans and respond to emails. But it’s important to know that as useful a tool as technology is, it can also inhibit us.\nFirst, the science. While we all believe ourselves to be excellent multitaskers, studies show that we can’t actually focus on more than one thing at a time - what we are doing is actually rapidly task switching between one task and the next, and that task switching takes time and energy, making us do both tasks more poorly. This means that if you’re toggling between your email, social media, text messages, or whatever other content might be up on your laptop, phone, or tablet in class, you are going to have a harder time learning the content in class and a harder time doing whatever else you are trying to do. In addition, studies have found that merely being in the presence of our smartphones can cause us to be distracted by them.\nI have found this to be true, and as a general rule, if I’m working on something that requires my focus, such as writing a lesson plan or working on research projects, I have a box in my office that I put my phone in so I can’t be distracted by it.\nOur goal in this class is to learn, and class time is an important time set aside for us to meet together in community to work towards the learning goals. In order to make sure you get the most out of that time, and to help support your classmates to not be distracted, I ask that you do the following:\n\nKeep your phone on silent and out of view throughout the duration of class\nClose all windows on your laptop or tablet that are not either your notes for the class, the Lyceum page or website for the class, a Mathematica notebook, or a PDF of the textbook\n\nIf the second one feels intimidating (what if you lose a window that was important for something you need to do later?), look into browser extensions that allow you to save tabs for later, like Mozilla Session Manager for Firefox or OneTab for Chrome.\nAll that said, I recognize that sometimes we have situations that require us to be reachable, so if you have a special circumstance that means you need to be able to take a call when it comes in, please talk to me about an exception to this policy.\nSince this policy is intended to support all members of the community, I will ask that we all work together to encourage each other to remain present during our class time. To do this, here is how we will put this policy into practice:\n\nIf you find yourself distracted by something on your computer, please\n\nacknowledge it\napologize if this occurred during group work (this doesn’t have to be a drawn out apology, just “I’m sorry, I got distracted, but I’m back now”)\nremove the distraction and return your attention to class.\n\nIf you notice your classmate is distracted, please\n\nacknowledge what you see gently (“Hey, I notice you’re checking your email right now”)\nthank them for returning their attention to the task at hand\nmove ahead with what you were doing (don’t make it a big event)\n\nIf I notice someone is distracted once (including having tabs open that are not relevant to the class), I will\n\nacknowledge it as discreetly as I can\nask you to close the distraction\n\nIf I notice someone is repeatedly distracted by the same thing during one class session, I will\n\nnote the previous instances\nask you to put away whatever device the distraction was on. If this means you need paper to take notes on, I will provide that.",

    "text": "Assignments and Grading\nAssignments fall into “bundles,” which contribute to your grade equally. Your performance on each bundle determines your base grade (by averaging the grade in each bundle using the 4-point GPA scale). Beyond that, you can achieve grade boosts, which round your grade up, e.g. from a B to a B+, or a B+ to an A-.\nYou can learn more about each bundle below:\nPractice\nUnit Tests\nFinal Project\nExcellence\n\nGrading Scheme\nAt the end of the term, you will earn a letter grade for this course. That letter grade will be determined following the Four-Square grading chart (below). Each square represents a grading bundle, and you can earn a score of 0-4 for each bundle. At the end of the term, I will calculate an average score for you using the following equation:\nOverall Score = (Practice score + Unit Tests score + Final Project score + Excellence score) / 4\n\nThe resulting overall score will correspond to a letter grade using the percentage table below:\n\nGrade table\n\n\nLetter Grade\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nA+\n97-100%\n\n\nA\n93-96.9%\n\n\nA-\n90-92.9%\n\n\nB+\n87-89.9%\n\n\nB\n83-86.9%\n\n\nB-\n80-82.9%\n\n\nC+\n77-79.9%\n\n\nC\n73-76.9%\n\n\nC-\n70-72.9%\n\n\nD+\n67-69.9%\n\n\nD\n63-66.9%\n\n\nD-\n60-62.9%\n\n\nF\nless than 60%\n\n\n\nYou can then get up to three grade boosts, each of which rounds your grade up (e.g from a B to B+ or from an A- to A). The grade boosts are described more below.\nIf, for example, you achieved a 3 in Practice, a 4 in Unit Tests, a 4 in Final Project, and got a total of 2 “Es”, your base grade would be (3.0 + 4.0 + 4.0 + 2.0)/16 = 81.3%, which would be a B-. With round-ups, your grade could go up to a B, B+, or A-.\n\n\nGrading scales\n\nPointsCompletionE/M/R/N\n\n\nHomeworks and pre-class quizzes will be graded on a points scale. Your total grade for the bundle will be your average points on the assignments. Remember that these are not graded on “correctness” but rather on engaging in good faith.\n\n\nThe five final project components will each have objectives you must meet for them to be considered “complete.” These will be clearly laid out for each component so you know exactly what to do to complete them.\n\n\nQuizzes, group problems, and community engagement are graded on this scale\n\nE: exceeds expectations\nM: meets expectations\nR: revise / retry\nN: no submission\n\nE and M are considered passing grades. The number of Es you get will contribute to your overall grade (see the grading scheme)\nR and N are considered failing grades.\nIn the case of quizzes and group problems, you will have one chance to revise/retry (see more under the assignment descriptions). Community engagement cannot be revised, as it is a reflection of your participation and engagement throughout the unit.\nUnder no circumstances can you revise something you receive an N on. Remember that done is better than perfect – turn your work in so you can receive feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading bundles\n\nPracticeUnit testsFinal ProjectExcellence\n\n\nPCQs: In order to get the most out of class, you need to prepare. We will spend most of our time in class practicing problem solving, and before class you will need to read the appropriate sections of the book and take a “quiz”. Some readings are longer than others (and I’ve included the page count in the course schedule so you can be prepared), but every reading quiz is 5 questions, some of which will be practice problems. Given the purpose of the pre-class quizzes, I will not offer extensions, except in case of a major medical or family emergency that causes you to miss class.\nWHW and self-assessment: There are nine homework sets (weekly for the first three-quarters of the semester) as well as a self-reflection form. You will turn in your work on the homework by scanning and uploading as a PDF to Lyceum. These are due by class time on Friday. You will then have a self-reflection due 72 hours later (by class time on Monday).\nThe problem sets are self-graded. Here’s how that works:\n\nYou get 50% of the points just for submitting the homework on time.\nWhen you submit your work, you will receive access to the (detailed) solutions.\nThe rest of the points come from comparing your work to the solutions and filling out a guided self-reflection form.\nThese forms are not intended to make you do “extra work” – these are to help both you and me understand where you need more practice and more support.\n\nYou may request extensions on the homeworks using the extension form.\n\nBundle grades\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\n4.0\nEarn &gt;= 90% average on WHWs AND complete &gt;= 90% of PCQs\n\n\n3.0\nEarn &gt;= 80% average on WHWs AND complete &gt;= 80% of PCQs\n\n\n2.0\nEarn &gt;= 70% average on WHWs AND complete &gt;= 70% of PCQs\n\n\n1.0\nEarn &gt;= 60% average on WHWs AND complete &gt;= 60% of PCQs\n\n\n0.0\nUnder a 60% average on WHWs OR under a 60% average on PCQs\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be three tests on the material in this class. Each test will be offered two times, two weeks apart, giving you two opportunities to achieve your desired grade on the tests. The tests are graded on an E/M/R/N scale, and an E and M are both considered passing grades.\nYou will be provided with an equation sheet for each test, which will have some useful equations, integrals, trig identities, etc. You may also bring a single-sided 8.5”x11” sheet of paper with equations and notes - hand-written (please speak to me if you need to type the sheet and we will come up with a plan). This paper will be turned in with your test.\nIf you have to miss class due to an approved excuse, you may take the test at the testing center. You must do this no more than 2 days before the test is given and no more than 5 days after (i.e. starting the Wednesday before the test and ending the Wednesday after the test), and you can request this option through AESS using this form. This is so I can provide timely feedback to everyone on the test. If you are not sure your absence is excused or you feel you have a special circumstance, come and talk to me about it and we will discuss the options.\nYou don’t have to do anything special to take the test a second time, but I recommend coming to my office hours or scheduling a meeting with me if you are at all confused about what you missed. I am more than happy to help talk you through the test.\n\nBundle grades\n\n\nPoints\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\n4.0\nAt least M on all 3\n\n\n3.0\nAt least M on 2\n\n\n2.0\nAt least M on 1\n\n\n1.0\nAll tests attempted (all Rs)\n\n\n0.0\nAny N grades\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this class, you will have had two semesters of instruction in quantum mechanics and be well-versed in the fundamentals and how to use the mathematics to derive real-world measurements. Now, you get a chance to pick something about quantum mechanics that you want to know more about and dig deeply.\nThis project is designed to be open-ended. I want you be as creative as you want to be. If you want to connect quantum mechanics to the arts, be my guest! If you want to do a deep dive into the historical development of the ideas of quantum mechanics, please enlighten us! If you want to do a computational project where you apply your programming skills to a concept you learned in this class, that would be awesome! If you want to teach a topic from the book that we haven’t covered yet to the rest of the class, we would love that! Want to record a podcast interviewing scientists in the field? Great!\nThink about where you want to stretch your understanding, and let that guide you.\nSince there is so much freedom, I’m building a lot of scaffolding into the process, and that scaffolding will be the basis of the grade.

    "text": "I’m Casey Berger and this is my second year at Bates College. At Bates, I’ve taught PHYS 211, PHYS 216, PHYS 301, PHYS 308, and PHYS 409. Before Bates, I was at Smith College in Physics and Statistical and Data Sciences. And long before that – before I went to school for physics and computational science – I studied philosophy, film production, and Spanish and worked in the film industry. It took me a long time to find my way to physics, but I wouldn’t change any of it. The long and winding path taught me so much more about who I am, what I am capable of, and how many opportunities are available in the world. It also taught me that it’s never too late to find a new passion or change your career direction.\nMy research involves applying high performance computing and data science techniques to many-body quantum systems, which just means studying how medium-to-large numbers of quantum objects like electrons, neutrons, or atoms interact with each other and their environment. This sounds straightforward, but unfortunately the mathematics of quantum mechanics means these problems become impossible to solve by hand and extremely challenging to solve even with high powered computers when the system is still only a few particles.\nOutside of physics, I am a person with lots of interests and hobbies. I love being outdoors in all seasons, but also love reading a book inside with a cup of tea. Ask me for book recommendations, recipes for interesting food, or great hikes in Maine!",
