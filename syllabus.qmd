## Who is the professor?

I'm Casey Berger and this is my second year at Bates College. At Bates, I've taught PHYS 211, PHYS 216, PHYS 301, PHYS 308, and PHYS 409. Before Bates, I was at Smith College in Physics and Statistical and Data Sciences. And long before that -- before I went to school for physics and computational science -- I studied philosophy, film production, and Spanish and worked in the film industry. It took me a long time to find my way to physics, but I wouldn't change any of it. The long and winding path taught me so much more about who I am, what I am capable of, and how many opportunities are available in the world. It also taught me that it's never too late to find a new passion or change your career direction.

My research involves applying high performance computing and data science techniques to many-body quantum systems, which just means studying how medium-to-large numbers of quantum objects like electrons, neutrons, or atoms interact with each other and their environment. This sounds straightforward, but unfortunately the mathematics of quantum mechanics means these problems become impossible to solve by hand and extremely challenging to solve even with high powered computers when the system is still only a few particles. 

Outside of physics, I am a person with lots of interests and hobbies. I love being outdoors in all seasons, but also love reading a book inside with a cup of tea. Ask me for book recommendations, recipes for interesting food, or great hikes in Maine!

## Classroom expectations {#classexpectations}

::: panel-tabset
### What you can expect from me

-   I will stay home if I am feeling sick and make arrangements to deliver the course material
-   I will work with you to arrange accommodations when you need them
-   I will respect your time by starting and ending class on time
-   I will answer your questions thoughtfully, and if I don't know the answer, I will follow up in a timely manner
-   I will embrace who you are as whole people
-   I will model respect, openness, and engagement, and foster a supportive and inclusive environment
-   I will be honest when I make mistakes, because failure is part of growing

### What I expect from you

-   That you will stay home if you are sick and contact me via email to arrange accommodations
-   That you genuinely attempt to engage with the course
-   That you ask questions if you are confused (you may do this privately -- there is no obligation to ask during class hours)
-   That you communicate with me when you have problems that interfere with your ability to engage with the coursework
-   That you treat your peers with respect and openness, and that you participate in creating an inclusive, supportive, and engaged classroom

### What is not expected
-   Perfection. Ever. It's a myth.
-   That you will 'sit still' or ask for permission to leave the classroom to go to the bathroom or if you just need a minute.
-   That everyone will learn in the same way. You do not have to match some "model student" to do well in this class

## Deadlines and Extensions {#deadlines}

If you need an extension, you may request one using [this form](https://forms.gle/eFx7y7FoSdoukKGC6). I recognize that things come up and you may require flexibility at some point in the semester. Please feel free to reach out to me directly if you are struggling to meet a deadline. I want to support you and make sure you have the best possible chance for success in this class, and the only way I can help is if you communicate with me. Extension requests are always due before the deadline. Work submitted after the deadline without an approved extension will not be graded.

In general, I am happy to be flexible. Please note, however, that some assignments will have stricter deadlines, which are discussed in their descriptions above.

## Technology Policy {#techpolicy}


### Use of LLMs {#llms}
Large Language Models (LLMs) are here to stay, but we should be discerning about how we use them. Banning them from the classroom is both pointless and actively unhelpful. If you are going to use ChatGPT or a similar LLM in this class, I only require two things:

1.    That you do a little reading on Large Language Models. Specifically, read 

-   [this article about how LLMs actually work](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/07/03/do-large-language-models-know-what-they-are-talking-about/) 
-    [this article about the ethical considerations around LLMs and intellectual property](https://montrealethics.ai/what-lies-behind-agi-ethical-concerns-related-to-llms/)

- [this article about just one of the many environmental impacts of LLMs](https://heated.world/p/data-centers-arent-just-guzzling)

2.    That you consider the LLM a source that you must cite. If you use generative AI to help with any assignment, you **must** acknowledge that help and give a short (two-sentence) description of what the LLM did for you and how it helped you solve the problem.

Remember that LLMs are designed to predict the most probable response to a question, which is not always the best or even correct response. They are prone to "hallucinating" (making stuff up, often in a way that is convincing but still false). They can't do creative problem solving, which is the most important skill we are trying to develop in this class.

### Use of technology during class time {#distractions}
Technology is completely infused into our lives, and I'm not trying to convince anyone to stop using it. As a computational physicist, it's my literal vocation to use digital technology, and as a teacher, I spend many hours a day staring at my screen to write lesson plans and respond to emails. But it's important to know that as useful a tool as technology is, it can also inhibit us. 

First, the science. While we all believe ourselves to be excellent multitaskers (okay maybe that's hyperbole), studies show that we can't actually focus on more than one thing at a time - what we are doing is actually rapidly task switching between one task and the next, and that [task switching takes time and energy, making us do both tasks more poorly](https://www.apa.org/topics/research/multitasking). This means that if you're toggling between your email, social media, text messages, or whatever other content might be up on your laptop, phone, or tablet in class, you are going to have a harder time learning the content in class *and* a harder time doing whatever else you are trying to do. In addition, studies have found that [merely being in the presence of our smartphones can cause us to be distracted by them](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/691462). 

I have found this to be extremely true, and as a general rule, if I'm working on something that requires my focus, such as writing a lesson plan or working on research projects, I have a box in my office that I put my phone in so I can't be distracted by it. 

Our goal in this class is to learn, and class time is an important time set aside for us to meet together in community to work towards the learning goals. In order to make sure you get the most out of that time, and to help support your classmates to not be distracted, I ask that you do the following:

-   Keep your phone on silent and out of view throughout the duration of class
-   Close all windows on your laptop or tablet that are not either your notes for the class, the Lyceum page or website for the class, a Mathematica notebook, or a PDF of the textbook

If the second one feels intimidating (what if you lose a window that was important for something you need to do later?), look into browser extensions that allow you to save tabs for later, like [Mozilla Session Manager for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-session-manager/) or [OneTab for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-search).

All that said, I recognize that sometimes we have situations that require us to be reachable, so if you have a special circumstance that means you need to be able to take a call when it comes in, please talk to me about an exception to this policy.

Since this policy is intended to support all members of the community, I will ask that we all work together to encourage each other to remain present during our class time. To do this, here is how we will put this policy into practice:

-   If you find yourself distracted by something on your computer, please 
    1. acknowledge it 
    2. apologize if this occurred during group work (this doesn't have to be a drawn out apology, just "I'm sorry, I got distracted, but I'm back now") 
    3. remove the distraction and return your attention to class.
-   If you notice your classmate is distracted, please 
    1. acknowledge what you see gently ("Hey, I notice you're checking your email right now")
    2. thank them for returning their attention to the task at hand
    3. move ahead with what you were doing (don't make it a big event)
-   If I notice someone is distracted once (including having tabs open that are not relevant to the class), I will
    1. acknowledge it as discreetly as I can
    2. ask you to close the distraction
-   If I notice someone is repeatedly distracted by the same thing during one class session, I will
    1. note the previous instances
    2. ask you to put away whatever device the distraction was on. If this means you need paper to take notes on, I will provide that.
-   If the distraction recurs over the course of the semester, it will affect your community engagement grade

## Assignments and Grading {#grading}

Assignments fall into "bundles," which contribute to your grade equally. Your performance on each bundle determines your base grade (by averaging the grade in each bundle using the 4-point GPA scale). Beyond that, you can achieve grade boosts, which round your grade up, e.g. from a B to a B+, or a B+ to an A-.

You can learn more about each bundle below:

[Practice](#practice)

[Unit Tests](#tests)

[Final Project](#finalproject)

[Excellence](#excellence)


### Grading Scheme {#gradingscheme}

At the end of the term, you will earn a letter grade for this course. That letter grade will be determined following the Four-Square grading chart (below). Each square represents a grading bundle, and you can earn a score of 0-4 for each bundle. At the end of the term, I will calculate an average score for you using the following equation: 

Overall Score = (Practice score + Unit Tests score + Final Project score + Excellence score) / 4

![](images/PHYS409foursquare.jpg){width=1000}

The resulting overall score will correspond to a letter grade using the percentage table below:

| Letter Grade	| Percentage |
|--------------|--------------|
|A+	    |   97-100%	    |
|A	    |   93-96.9%    |
|A-	    |   90-92.9%    |
|B+	    |   87-89.9%    |
|B	    |   83-86.9%    |
|B-	    |   80-82.9%    |
|C+	    |   77-79.9%    |
|C	    |   73-76.9%	  |
|C-	    |   70-72.9%    |
|D+	    |   67-69.9%    |   
|D	    |   63-66.9%    |
|D-	    |   60-62.9%    |
|F	    |   less than 60%	|
: Grade table  {.striped .hover}

You can then get up to three grade boosts, each of which rounds your grade up (e.g from a B to B+ or from an A- to A). The [grade boosts](#boosts) are described more below.

If, for example, you achieved a 3 in Practice, a 4 in Unit Tests, a 4 in Final Project, and got a total of 2 "Es", your base grade would be (3.0 + 4.0 + 4.0 + 2.0)/16 = 81.3%, which would be a B-. With round-ups, your grade could go up to a B, B+, or A-.

### Grading scales
::: panel-tabset
#### Points
Homeworks and pre-class quizzes will be graded on a points scale. Your total grade for the bundle will be your average points on the assignments. Remember that these are not graded on "correctness" but rather on engaging in good faith.

#### Completion
The five final project components will each have objectives you must meet for them to be considered "complete." These will be clearly laid out for each component so you know exactly what to do to complete them.

#### E/M/R/N {#emrn}
Quizzes, group problems, and community engagement are graded on this scale

- E: exceeds expectations
- M: meets expectations 
- R: revise / retry
- N: no submission 

E and M are considered passing grades. The number of Es you get will contribute to your overall grade (see the [grading scheme](#gradingscheme))

R and N are considered failing grades. 

In the case of quizzes and group problems, you will have one chance to revise/retry (see more under the assignment descriptions). Community engagement cannot be revised, as it is a reflection of your participation and engagement throughout the unit.

Under no circumstances can you revise something you receive an N on. Remember that done is better than perfect -- turn your work in so you can receive feedback.

### Grading bundles {#assignments}

::: panel-tabset
#### Practice {#practice}

PCQs: In order to get the most out of class, you need to prepare. We will spend most of our time in class practicing problem solving, and before class you will need to read the appropriate sections of the book and take a "quiz". Some readings are longer than others (and I've included the page count in the [course schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CqRi4OO0C813qEICXgECEvbFbTLgb9dMyQzDIpmoQxc/edit?usp=sharing) so you can be prepared), but every reading quiz is 5 questions, some of which will be practice problems. *Given the purpose of the pre-class quizzes, I will not offer extensions, except in case of a major medical or family emergency that causes you to miss class.*

WHW and self-assessment: There are nine homework sets (weekly for the first three-quarters of the semester) as well as a self-reflection form. You will turn in your work on the homework by scanning and uploading as a PDF to Lyceum. These are due by class time on Friday. You will then have a self-reflection due 72 hours later (by class time on Monday).

The problem sets are self-graded. Here’s how that works:

-   You get 50% of the points just for submitting the homework on time.
-   When you submit your work, you will receive access to the (detailed) solutions.
-   The rest of the points come from comparing your work to the solutions and filling out a guided self-reflection form.
-   These forms are not intended to make you do “extra work” – these are to help both you and me understand where you need more practice and more support.

You may request extensions on the homeworks using the [extension form](https://forms.gle/eFx7y7FoSdoukKGC6).

| Points  | Requirements                  |
|------|--------------------|
| 4.0     | Earn >= 90% average on WHWs AND complete >= 90%  of PCQs        |
| 3.0     | Earn >= 80% average on WHWs AND complete >= 80%  of PCQs        |
| 2.0     | Earn >= 70% average on WHWs AND complete >= 70%  of PCQs        |
| 1.0     | Earn >= 60% average on WHWs AND complete >= 60%  of PCQs        |
| 0.0     | Under a 60% average on WHWs OR under a 60% average on PCQs      |
: Bundle grades {.striped .hover}

#### Unit tests {#tests}

There will be three tests on the material in this class. Each test will be offered two times, two weeks apart, giving you two opportunities to achieve your desired grade on the tests. The tests are graded on an [E/M/R/N scale](#emrn), and an E and M are both considered passing grades. 

You will be provided with an equation sheet for each test, which will have some useful equations, integrals, trig identities, etc. You may also bring a single-sided 8.5"x11" sheet of paper with equations and notes - hand-written (please speak to me if you need to type the sheet and we will come up with a plan). This paper will be turned in with your test.

If you have to miss class due to an approved excuse, you may take the test at the testing center. You must do this no more than 2 days before the test is given and no more than 5 days after (i.e. starting the Wednesday before the test and ending the Wednesday after the test), and you can request this option through AESS using this [form](https://www.bates.edu/accessible-education-student-support/makeup-exam-requests/). This is so I can provide timely feedback to everyone on the test. If you are not sure your absence is excused or you feel you have a special circumstance, come and talk to me about it and we will discuss the options.

You don't have to do anything special to take the test a second time, but I recommend coming to my office hours or scheduling a meeting with me if you are at all confused about what you missed. I am more than happy to help talk you through the test.

| Points  | Requirements    |
|------|--------------------|
| 4.0   | At least M on all 3 |
| 3.0   | At least M on 2     |
| 2.0   | At least M on 1     |
| 1.0   | All tests attempted (all Rs)  |
| 0.0   | Any N grades         |
: Bundle grades {.striped .hover}

#### Final Project {#finalproject}

By the end of this class, you will have had two semesters of instruction in quantum mechanics and be well-versed in the fundamentals and how to use the mathematics to derive real-world measurements. Now, you get a chance to pick something about quantum mechanics that you want to know more about and dig deeply.

This project is designed to be open-ended. I want you be as creative as you want to be. If you want to connect quantum mechanics to the arts, be my guest! If you want to do a deep dive into the historical development of the ideas of quantum mechanics, please enlighten us! If you want to do a computational project where you apply your programming skills to a concept you learned in this class, that would be awesome! If you want to teach a topic from the book that we haven’t covered yet to the rest of the class, we would love that! Want to record a podcast interviewing scientists in the field? Great!

Think about where you want to stretch your understanding, and let that guide you.

Since there is so much freedom, I’m building a lot of scaffolding into the process, and that scaffolding will be the basis of the grade. So if you want to take a big risk and try something new, you don’t have to worry that if it doesn’t go well, you will fail. The scaffolding is detailed on Lyceum, and there are five parts: 

- the pitch
- the proposal
- the annotated bibliography
- the progress report
- the final presentation and write-up.

While everything is graded on "completion," I reserve the right to give a bonus "E" grade on the final presentation and write-up for projects that go above and beyond. This "E" counts toward the [Excellence](#excellence) grade bundle.

A note on what I mean by "complete" -- this must be your own original work to count. Even if the project doesn't get where you want it to, it cannot be AI-generated or plaigiarized in any other way. If you wish to use AI as part of the project, you must talk to me about it (e.g. in your pitch and/or proposal), and we must agree on an acceptable use of the technology before you can use it. 

| Points  | Requirements    |
|------|--------------------|
| 4.0   | Complete all 5 components |
| 3.0   | Complete the proposal and final presentation and write-up, plus any 2 other components  |
| 2.0   | Complete the proposal and final presentation and write-up, plus any 1 other component  |
| 1.0   | Complete the proposal and final presentation and write-up |
| 0.0   | Proposal and/or final presentation and write-up are not completed |

#### Excellence {#excellence}
There are 4 potential "E" grades you can earn in this class: 3 unit tests and the final project. Every "E" you receive will be counted in this category and goes toward your final grade.

| Points  | Requirements     |
|------|--------------------|
| 4.0    | 4 Es        |
| 3.0    | 3 Es        |
| 2.0    | 2 Es        |
| 1.0    | 1 E         |
| 0.0    | No Es       |

### Grading boosts
Your base grade will be calculated from the table above, but you can round your grade up in a number of ways.

I will apply as many grade boosts as you achieve, with one exception:

You can only achieve an A+ in this class if you receive a base A grade. The A+ grade does not have an impact on your GPA, and so I am reserving it as a way of acknowledging especially excellent work across the course of the semester.

::: panel-tabset

#### Time Management

If you use no more than 3 extension requests all semester, I will round your grade up.

#### Completionist

If you get 100% on the homework or the pre-class quizzes, I will round your grade up (one round-up only).

#### Growth Boost

If you demonstrate consistent improvement in your work across the semester, I will round your grade up.

:::

## Deadlines and Extensions {#deadlines}
If you need an extension, you may request one using [this form](https://forms.gle/eFx7y7FoSdoukKGC6). I recognize that things come up and you may require flexibility at some point in the semester. Please feel free to reach out to me directly if you are struggling to meet a deadline. I want to support you and make sure you have the best possible chance for success in this class, and the only way I can help is if you communicate with me. Extension requests are always due before the deadline. Work submitted after the deadline without an approved extension will not be graded.

In general, I am happy to be flexible. Please note, however, that some assignments will have stricter deadlines. These assignments include the reading quizzes and the final project presentation, and the nature of the deadlines is discussed in their descriptions above.
