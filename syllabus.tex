\section{Classroom expectations}\label{classexpectations}

\subsection{What you can expect from me}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I will stay home if I am feeling sick and make arrangements to deliver
  the course material
\item
  I will work with you to arrange accommodations when you need them
\item
  I will respect your time by starting and ending class on time
\item
  I will answer your questions thoughtfully, and if I don't know the
  answer, I will follow up in a timely manner
\item
  I will embrace who you are as whole people
\item
  I will model respect, openness, and engagement, and foster a
  supportive and inclusive environment
\item
  I will be honest when I make mistakes, because failure is part of
  growing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What I expect from you}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  That you will stay home if you are sick and contact me via email to
  arrange accommodations
\item
  That you genuinely attempt to engage with the course
\item
  That you ask questions if you are confused (you may do this privately
  -- there is no obligation to ask during class hours)
\item
  That you communicate with me when you have problems that interfere
  with your ability to engage with the coursework
\item
  That you treat your peers with respect and openness, and that you
  participate in creating an inclusive, supportive, and engaged
  classroom
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What is not expected}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Perfection. Ever. It's a myth.
\item
  That you will `sit still' or ask for permission to leave the classroom
  to go to the bathroom or if you just need a minute.
\item
  That everyone will learn in the same way. You do not have to match
  some ``model student'' to do well in this class
\end{itemize}

\section{Assignments and Grading}\label{assignments}

Assignments fall into ``bundles,'' which contribute to your grade
equally. Your performance on each bundle determines your base grade (by
averaging the grade in each bundle using the 4-point GPA scale). Beyond
that, you can achieve grade boosts, which round your grade up, e.g.~from
a B to a B+, or a B+ to an A-.

You can learn more about each bundle below:

\hyperref[practice]{Practice}

\hyperref[tests]{Unit Tests}

\hyperref[finalproject]{Final Project}

\hyperref[excellence]{Excellence}

\subsection{Grading Scheme}\label{gradingscheme}

At the end of the term, you will earn a letter grade for this course.
That letter grade will be determined following the Four-Square grading
chart (below). Each square represents a grading bundle, and you can earn
a score of 0-4 for each bundle. At the end of the term, I will calculate
an average score for you using the following equation:

Overall Score = (Practice score + Unit Tests score + Final Project score
+ Excellence score) / 4

\includegraphics[width=10.41667in,height=\textheight]{images/PHYS409foursquare.jpg}

The resulting overall score will correspond to a letter grade using the
\href{https://catalog.bates.edu/academics/academic-policies/grading-system/}{Bates
College 4-point GPA table}. You can then get up to three grade boosts,
each of which rounds your grade up (e.g from a B to B+ or from an A- to
A). The \hyperref[boosts]{grade boosts} are described more below.

If, for example, you achieved a 2 in Practice, a 4 in Unit Tests, a 3 in
Final Project, and got a total of 2 ``Es'', your base grade would be
(2.0 + 4.0 + 3.0 + 2.0)/4 = 2.75, which would be a B-. With round-ups,
your grade could go up to a B, B+, or A-.

\subsection{Grading scales}\label{grading-scales}

\subsubsection{Points}

Homeworks and pre-class quizzes will be graded on a points scale. Your
total grade for the bundle will be your average points on the
assignments. Remember that these are not graded on ``correctness'' but
rather on engaging in good faith.

\subsubsection{Completion}

The five final project components will each have objectives you must
meet for them to be considered ``complete.'' These will be clearly laid
out for each component so you know exactly what to do to complete them.

\subsubsection{E/M/R/N}

Quizzes, group problems, and community engagement are graded on this
scale

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  E: exceeds expectations
\item
  M: meets expectations
\item
  R: revise / retry
\item
  N: no submission
\end{itemize}

E and M are considered passing grades. The number of Es you get will
contribute to your overall grade (see the
\hyperref[gradingscheme]{grading scheme})

R and N are considered failing grades.

In the case of quizzes and group problems, you will have one chance to
revise/retry (see more under the assignment descriptions). Community
engagement cannot be revised, as it is a reflection of your
participation and engagement throughout the unit.

Under no circumstances can you revise something you receive an N on.
Remember that done is better than perfect -- turn your work in so you
can receive feedback.

\subsection{Grading categories}\label{categories}

\subsubsection{Practice}

PCQs: In order to get the most out of class, you need to prepare. We
will spend most of our time in class practicing problem solving, and
before class you will need to read the appropriate sections of the book
and take a ``quiz''. Some readings are longer than others (and I've
included the page count in the
\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CqRi4OO0C813qEICXgECEvbFbTLgb9dMyQzDIpmoQxc/edit?usp=sharing}{course
schedule} so you can be prepared), but every reading quiz is 5
questions, some of which will be practice problems. \emph{Given the
purpose of the pre-class quizzes, I will not offer extensions, except in
case of a major medical or family emergency that causes you to miss
class.}

WHW and self-assessment: There are nine homework sets (weekly for the
first three-quarters of the semester) as well as a self-reflection form.
You will turn in your work on the homework by scanning and uploading as
a PDF to Lyceum. These are due by class time on Friday. You will then
have a self-reflection due 72 hours later (by class time on Monday).

The problem sets are self-graded. Here's how that works:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You get 50\% of the points just for submitting the homework on time.
\item
  When you submit your work, you will receive access to the (detailed)
  solutions.
\item
  The rest of the points come from comparing your work to the solutions
  and filling out a guided self-reflection form.
\item
  These forms are not intended to make you do ``extra work'' -- these
  are to help both you and me understand where you need more practice
  and more support.
\end{itemize}

You may request extensions on the homeworks using the
\href{https://forms.gle/eFx7y7FoSdoukKGC6}{extension form}.

0.0 & Under a 60\% average on WHWs OR under a 60\% average on PCQs \\
\end{longtable}

\subsubsection{Unit tests}

There will be three tests on the material in this class. Each test will
be offered two times, two weeks apart, giving you two opportunities to
achieve your desired grade on the tests. The tests are graded on an
\hyperref[emrn]{E/M/R/N scale}, and an E and M are both considered
passing grades.

You will be provided with an equation sheet for each test, which will
have some useful equations, integrals, trig identities, etc. You may
also bring a single-sided 8.5''x11'' sheet of paper with equations and
notes - hand-written (please speak to me if you need to type the sheet
and we will come up with a plan). This paper will be turned in with your
test.

If you have to miss class due to an approved excuse, you may take the
test at the testing center. You must do this no more than 2 days before
the test is given and no more than 5 days after (i.e.~starting the
Wednesday before the test and ending the Wednesday after the test), and
you can request this option through AESS using this
\href{https://www.bates.edu/accessible-education-student-support/makeup-exam-requests/}{form}.
This is so I can provide timely feedback to everyone on the test. If you
are not sure your absence is excused or you feel you have a special
circumstance, come and talk to me about it and we will discuss the
options.

You don't have to do anything special to take the test a second time,
but I recommend coming to my office hours or scheduling a meeting with
me if you are at all confused about what you missed. I am more than
happy to help talk you through the test.

\end{longtable}

\subsubsection{Final Project}

By the end of this class, you will have had two semesters of instruction
in quantum mechanics and be well-versed in the fundamentals and how to
use the mathematics to derive real-world measurements. Now, you get a
chance to pick something about quantum mechanics that you want to know
more about and dig deeply.

This project is designed to be open-ended. I want you be as creative as
you want to be. If you want to connect quantum mechanics to the arts, be
my guest! If you want to do a deep dive into the historical development
of the ideas of quantum mechanics, please enlighten us! If you want to
do a computational project where you apply your programming skills to a
concept you learned in this class, that would be awesome! If you want to
teach a topic from the book that we haven't covered yet to the rest of
the class, we would love that! Want to record a podcast interviewing
scientists in the field? Great!

Think about where you want to stretch your understanding, and let that
guide you.

Since there is so much freedom, I'm building a lot of scaffolding into
the process, and that scaffolding will be the basis of the grade. So if
you want to take a big risk and try something new, you don't have to
worry that if it doesn't go well, you will fail. The scaffolding is
detailed on Lyceum, and there are five parts:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the pitch
\item
  the proposal
\item
  the annotated bibliography
\item
  the progress report
\item
  the final presentation and write-up.
\end{itemize}

While everything is graded on ``completion,'' I reserve the right to
give a bonus ``E'' grade on the final presentation and write-up for
projects that go above and beyond. This ``E'' counts toward the
\hyperref[excellence]{Excellence} grade bundle.

A note on what I mean by ``complete'' -- this must be your own original
work to count. Even if the project doesn't get where you want it to, it
cannot be AI-generated or plaigiarized in any other way. If you wish to
use AI as part of the project, you must talk to me about it (e.g.~in
your pitch and/or proposal), and we must agree on an acceptable use of
the technology before you can use it.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.2308}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.7692}}@{}}

4.0 & Complete all 5 components \\
3.0 & Complete the proposal and final presentation and write-up, plus

2.0 & Complete the proposal and final presentation and write-up, plus
any 1 other component \\
1.0 & Complete the proposal and final presentation and write-up \\
0.0 & Proposal and/or final presentation and write-up are not
completed \\
\end{longtable}

\subsubsection{Excellence}

There are 4 potential ``E'' grades you can earn in this class: 3 unit
tests and the final project. Every ``E'' you receive will be counted in
this category and goes toward your final grade.

\end{longtable}

\subsection{Grading boosts}\label{grading-boosts}

Your base grade will be calculated from the table above, but you can
round your grade up in a number of ways.

I will apply as many grade boosts as you achieve, with one exception:

You can only achieve an A+ in this class if you receive a base A grade.
The A+ grade does not have an impact on your GPA, and so I am reserving
it as a way of acknowledging especially excellent work across the course
of the semester.

\subsubsection{Time Management}

If you use no more than 3 extension requests all semester, I will round
your grade up.

\subsubsection{Completionist}

If you get 100\% on the homework or the pre-class quizzes, I will round
your grade up (one round-up only).

\subsubsection{Growth Boost}

If you demonstrate consistent improvement in your work across the
semester, I will round your grade up.

\section{Deadlines and Extensions}\label{deadlines}

If you need an extension, you may request one using
\href{https://forms.gle/eFx7y7FoSdoukKGC6}{this form}. I recognize that
things come up and you may require flexibility at some point in the
semester. Please feel free to reach out to me directly if you are
struggling to meet a deadline. I want to support you and make sure you
have the best possible chance for success in this class, and the only
way I can help is if you communicate with me. Extension requests are
always due before the deadline. Work submitted after the deadline
without an approved extension will not be graded.

In general, I am happy to be flexible. Please note, however, that some
assignments will have stricter deadlines. These assignments include the
reading quizzes and the final project presentation, and the nature of
the deadlines is discussed in their descriptions above.
